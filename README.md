# OS_DriverMetadataExtractionCodes_RCM_C-band_SARdata
The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) refers to three satellites launched in 2019 and operated 
by the Government of Canada. These satellites collect both C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) 
image data and ship-self-reporting Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from water-borne 
vessels. The files in this repository provide: (i) GDAL C++ driver code to open and ingest the 
C-band SAR images; and (ii) Python code to extract metadata from the C-band SAR images and compute 
other relevant quantities. These codes have been compiled and run on Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu 
18.04.
